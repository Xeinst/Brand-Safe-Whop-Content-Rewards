## üîß Permission Implementation

### In Your App Code

The permissions are automatically handled by the Whop SDK:

```typescript
// User information (requires read_user, read_user_profile)
const user = await sdk.getUser()
const isMember = sdk.isWhopMember()

// Company information (requires read_company)
const company = await sdk.getCompany()

// Content management (requires read_content, write_content)
const submissions = await sdk.getContentSubmissions()
await sdk.submitContent(contentData)

// Analytics (requires read_analytics)
const analytics = await sdk.getAnalytics()

// Member Statistics Export (requires member:stats:export)
const memberStats = await sdk.getMemberStatistics()
await sdk.exportMemberStats(format, dateRange)

// Payments (requires read_payments, write_payments)
const earnings = await sdk.getEarnings()
await sdk.processPayout(payoutData)
```

### Automatic Role Detection

With proper permissions, the app automatically detects user roles:

```typescript
// This works because we have read_company_members permission
const detectUserRole = async () => {
  const isWhopMember = sdk.isWhopMember()
  
  if (isWhopMember) {
    // User is a Whop community member ‚Üí Content Creator
    setUserRole('creator')
  } else {
    // User is not a member ‚Üí Brand Manager
    setUserRole('brand')
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
