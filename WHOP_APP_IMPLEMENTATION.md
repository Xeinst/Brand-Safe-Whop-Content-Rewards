# Whop App Implementation - Owner Dashboard & Member Experience

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of two key surfaces for the Brand Safe Content Rewards Whop app:

1. **Owner Dashboard** (`/dashboard/[companyId]`) - Campaign management and content review
2. **Member Experience** (`/experiences/[experienceId]`) - Content upload and earnings tracking

## âœ… Implementation Complete

### 1. Routing & Guards
- **`middleware.ts`** - Route protection for dashboard and experience pages
- **`lib/whop-authz.ts`** - Authorization utilities for access control
- **Route Protection**:
  - `/dashboard/*` â†’ Only ADMIN/OWNER access
  - `/experiences/*` â†’ Only users with ACTIVE membership for that experienceId

### 2. Database Schema (Updated)
- **Campaigns Table**: `id`, `name`, `advertiser_id`, `cpm_cents`, `budget_cents`, `start_at`, `end_at`, `active`, `rules_id`, `company_id`
- **Content Submissions**: Updated with `creator_id`, `campaign_id`, `storage_key`, `thumb_key`
- **Impression Aggregates**: `submission_id`, `date`, `region`, `device`, `verified_views`
- **Payouts**: `creator_id`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `amount_cents`, `breakdown_json`, `status`, `external_ref`
- **Experiences**: `whop_experience_id`, `company_id`, `name`, `active`
- **Memberships**: `user_id`, `experience_id`, `whop_membership_id`, `status`, `expires_at`

### 3. API Routes (Next.js Route Handlers)

#### Campaigns (Owner/Admin)
- **`POST /api/admin/campaigns`** â†’ Create campaign
- **`PATCH /api/admin/campaigns/:id`** â†’ Update campaign (name, cpmCents, dates, active, rulesId, budgetCents)
- **`POST /api/admin/campaigns/:id/toggle`** â†’ Start/stop campaign (flip active)
- **`GET /api/admin/campaigns`** â†’ List campaigns with basic stats

#### Submissions (Member Upload + Owner Review)
- **`POST /api/submissions`** â†’ Member upload (forces status=PENDING_REVIEW, visibility=PRIVATE)
- **`GET /api/me/submissions`** â†’ Member's own submissions
- **`GET /api/admin/review-queue`** â†’ Owner list (PENDING_REVIEW|FLAGGED)
- **`POST /api/admin/submissions/:id/approve`** â†’ Sets status=APPROVED, visibility=PUBLIC, approvedAt=now()
- **`POST /api/admin/submissions/:id/reject`** â†’ Sets status=REJECTED, visibility=PRIVATE, rejectedAt=now(), reviewNote=note

#### Impressions (Updated)
- **`POST /api/events/view`** â†’ Only counts views for status=APPROVED and visibility=PUBLIC content
- **Pre-approval impressions ignored** â†’ Post-approval impressions accrue and pay

#### Earnings & Payouts
- **`GET /api/earnings/summary?period=YYYY-MM`** â†’ Member earnings: sum verifiedViews * (campaign.cpmCents/1000)
- **`POST /api/payouts/run?period=YYYY-MM`** â†’ Admin: create Payout rows
- **`POST /api/payouts/send/:id`** â†’ Admin: call provider (Whop/export), update status/externalRef

### 4. Pages / UI (React Components)

#### `/dashboard/[companyId]` (Owner Dashboard)
**Sections:**
1. **Campaigns Table**:
   - Name, CPM, Active, Start/End, Budget (optional), Actions: Edit, Start/Stop
   - Button: New Campaign (modal/form posts to `/api/admin/campaigns`)

2. **Review Queue**:
   - Table: Thumb, Title, Creator, CreatedAt, optional Mod scores/reasons
   - Row actions: Approve (POST approve), Reject (modal for note)

#### `/experiences/[experienceId]` (Member Experience)
**Sections:**
1. **Upload**:
   - Upload UI (presigned URL or existing uploader), posts to `/api/submissions`

2. **My Submissions**:
   - Table: Thumb, Title, Status badge (Pending/Approved/Rejected), ReviewNote if rejected
   - Public link only when APPROVED+PUBLIC

3. **Earnings**:
   - Period selector (month); call `/api/earnings/summary`
   - Show total + per-submission breakdown
   - If there are payouts, list last payout with status

### 5. Public Filtering (Critical)
- **All public listing/player/search endpoints** now filter by:
  ```sql
  WHERE status = 'APPROVED' AND visibility = 'PUBLIC'
  ```

### 6. Storage/CDN Security
- **`lib/storage.ts`** - Secure storage utilities
- **Private content**: Served via signed URLs only
- **Approved content**: Public URLs (or signed but drop auth checks)
- **`/api/secure-content`** - Protected access to private content

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria (All Pass)

1. **Owner can create a campaign, toggle active, and edit CPM/dates** âœ…
2. **Member with active Whop membership can open `/experiences/[experienceId]`, upload, and see their items** âœ…
3. **New upload is PENDING_REVIEW + PRIVATE and not visible publicly** âœ…
4. **Owner approves â†’ item becomes APPROVED + PUBLIC; impressions are now accepted and counted; earnings reflect CPM correctly** âœ…
5. **Rejected items remain private with a visible reviewNote to the member** âœ…
6. **Running payouts for a month creates payout rows; sending (or export path) marks SENT with externalRef** âœ…
7. **Middleware correctly blocks unauthorized access to dashboard/experience** âœ…
8. **Pre-approval impressions are ignored; post-approval impressions accrue/pay** âœ…
