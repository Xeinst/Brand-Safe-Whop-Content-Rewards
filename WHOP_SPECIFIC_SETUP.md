## 🎯 Whop-Specific Features

### Whop SDK Integration

  private sdk: OfficialWhopSDK | null = null
  
  async init(): Promise<void> {
    try {
      this.sdk = new OfficialWhopSDK({

        appSecret: import.meta.env.VITE_WHOP_APP_SECRET,
        environment: import.meta.env.VITE_WHOP_APP_ENV
      })
      
      await this.sdk.init()
      // Get Whop user and company data
    } catch (error) {
      // Fallback to mock data for development
    }
  }
}
```
